👋 Hi, I'm Harry. Welcome to My GitHub!

Thanks for stopping by! I’m a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building web applications that are not only dynamic and visually appealing but also secure and efficient behind the scenes.

🛠️ A Little About What I Do:

Front End:
- I love working with **React.js** to create user interfaces that feel responsive and engaging.
- Styling is just as important, and I use **CSS** to bring designs to life with smooth, intuitive user experiences.
 
Back End:
- I use **Node.js** and **Express** to handle the server side, building scalable applications that are secure and performant.
- **MySQL** is my go-to for managing data—it’s reliable and gets the job done efficiently.
