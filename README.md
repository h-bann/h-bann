👋 Hi, I'm Harry. 

I’m a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building web applications that are not only dynamic and visually appealing but also secure and efficient behind the scenes. I come from a ten year background of nursing, working in a variety of settings such as intensive care, resuscitation and organ donation. 

🛠️ What I do:

Front End:
- I love working with **React.js** to create user interfaces that feel responsive and engaging. I use this knowledge to make the most of all the **NextJS** features in my most refent projects. 
- Styling is just as important, and I use **CSS** and **Tailwind** to bring designs to life with smooth, intuitive user experiences.
 
Back End:
- I use **Node.js** and initially learnt to use **Express** to handle the server side, building scalable applications that are secure and performant. More recently, I've been using **NextJS** for all things server. 
- **MySQL** is my go-to for managing data—it’s reliable and gets the job done efficiently.


My pinned projects show all of this at work. Feel free to contact me via Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry--bannister/)
